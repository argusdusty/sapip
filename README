"Safe Asynchronous Periodic Indexed Priority Queue"
Safe: Multiple threads can access the return value of each command
Asynchronous: Multiple commands can be run simultaneously, up to a defined limit.
Periodic: The top command is executed/removed on a periodic basis, over a periodic delay
Indexed: Each command is uniquely defined by a string, which can allow log-time lookup. This string serves as the input value for the commands
Priority: Lowest priority command goes first. Supports multiple commands having the same priority.
Queue: First in, first out, under a given priority.

Commands are functions which take a string (their name) as input and return a string. Feel free to modify those data types to support other return/input values. I didn't want to use the generalized interface{} for performance reasons.
